H35N Light Meter (Web App)

A minimal, browser-based light meter for the Kodak H35N half-frame film camera, designed for iPhone (but works on any modern device with a camera).
It uses your phone‚Äôs camera feed to estimate exposure, lets you select your film stock ISO, and toggle Flash ON/OFF to match the H35N‚Äôs fixed settings.
Built as a single HTML file ‚Äî no install needed, just open in Safari/Chrome over HTTPS.

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Live camera preview with center target box for metering.
	‚Ä¢	Film stock ISO selector (ISO 50 ‚Üí 3200).
	‚Ä¢	Flash ON/OFF toggle:
	‚Ä¢	ON ‚Üí approx. f/8 @ 1/100s
	‚Ä¢	OFF ‚Üí approx. f/11 @ 1/100s
	‚Ä¢	Underexposure readout in stops (e.g., ‚ÄúUnder by 1.3 stops‚Äù).
	‚Ä¢	Calibration panel for real-world accuracy:
	‚Ä¢	Quick presets (Sunny, Hazy, Overcast, Shade) based on EV at ISO 100.
	‚Ä¢	Manual EV set using a gray card or mid-tone surface.
	‚Ä¢	Persistent calibration (saves in local browser storage).
	‚Ä¢	Runs entirely client-side ‚Äî no data is sent anywhere.
üì∑ How it Works

Because web browsers auto-expose the video feed and don‚Äôt expose actual aperture/shutter data, the app uses a calibration approach:
	1.	Measures average brightness of the center box (Rec.709 weighted luma).
	2.	Converts to EV (Exposure Value) using your calibration constant.
	3.	Compares the scene EV to the H35N‚Äôs fixed shutter/aperture and your selected ISO.
	4.	Displays how many stops you are underexposed (negative values).

üõ† Setup & Usage

1. Open the App
	‚Ä¢	Host the index.html file on a HTTPS server, or open it directly on your Mac and access it on your iPhone.
	‚Ä¢	Example local test:
‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Works best outdoors or in bright light; very dark scenes may be noisy.
	‚Ä¢	Calibration is scene-specific ‚Äî recalibrate when lighting changes.
	‚Ä¢	Browser metering is approximate; this tool is for quick reference, not lab accuracy.
	‚Ä¢	Tested primarily on iPhone 15 Safari.
